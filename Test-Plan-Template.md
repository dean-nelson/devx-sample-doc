## Introduction

Description

## Test Approach

The test approach

## Test Plan Checklist

* [ ] UI Testing
* [ ] Negative Testing
* [ ] Usability testing
* [ ] Component testing
* [ ] Integration testing
* [ ] API & Contract testing
* [ ] HA/DR testing
* [ ] Scale & Performance
* [ ] Security testing
* [ ] Soak and Longevity testing

## Execution approach

## Risks and Assumptions

Service ABC is complete and can be deployed

## Scope

### Feature Testing Scope (IS)

This is what will be tested

* **Stuff**
  * Detail 1
  * Detail 2
  * Detail 3
  
* **More Stuff**
  * More Detail 1
  * More Detail 2
  
> Note: Feature Testing Scope planning depends on some designs yet to be done, for this reason some points can be added or removed.  

### Feature Testing Scope (IS-NOT)

* **Not Stuff**
  * Detail 1
  
* **More Not Stuff**
  * More Detail 1

## Dependencies (Include external components and environmental dependencies)

Service A must be running, Service B must be running

## Test Cases

### Feature 1 (Import feature from desgn doc?  Validate coverage?)

### Test Case 1 - Summary (Description can be exported to actual test.  Should we validate tests are written?)

```text
  [Documentation] for PyTest
  ...    == Test Case Name  ==
  ...     Test case name .e.g.  Valid User Login
  ...
  ...    == Description ==
  ...     Well written discription
  ...
  ...    ==  Workflow ==
  ...     Workflow name e.g. GLCP Login Workflow
  ...
  ...    == Automation ==
  ...     Automated | Manual
  ...
  ...    == Precondition ==
  ...     Precondiation for this test  e.g. user is created and registered in the system
  ...
  ...    == Run Method ==
  ...     Type: Automated | Manual  
  ...
  ...    == Steps ==
  ...    Go to HPE GreenLake 
  ...    Enter valid user and clock Login
  ...    Step 3
  ...    
  ...    == Expected Result ==
  ...    User is logged in successfully
  ...

## Failure modes (Can link back to feature design)

Identify possible failure situations that you are accounting for

* Case 1
* Case 2

## Security

Example - The current security scans must run successfully with out regressions.

## Performance, Scale and Longevity

## Shared Library and Test Automation Suggestions

* Idea 1
* Idea 2
* Idea 3
