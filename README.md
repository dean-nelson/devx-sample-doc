# glcp-sample-templates
The sample templates are written in mark down for easy integration in to our github development environment.  It is best to keep the documents withe the code.

# Future
There are some future integrations that are easier to implment with with the markdown version.  This includes 
* Easier tracking of updates
* Ensuring that test plans are changed when design changes are made
* Extracting test cases or test case frameworks
