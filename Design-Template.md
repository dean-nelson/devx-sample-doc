## Design

### Design Considerations

    ## Consideration 1

    ## Consideration 2

### Feature 1 (could be exported to test plan,  should we require 1:1 in test plan?)

### Feature 2

## Failure modes

Identify possible failure situations that are not explicitly covered by your design.

Example:

| Feature/Function| Failure/Cause| Impact | Risk | Probabilty | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Data Entry | SQL Injection  | Security and Data Risk  | 9 | 6 | Input scrub |
| Invalid zip| User error | Data integrity  | 3 | 5 | Data validation |
| | | | | | |
